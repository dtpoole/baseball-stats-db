# Baseball Databank Tools

This is a project created to make creating databases based off of the [Baseball Databank files](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank).  The project includes the `bdloader` utility 
that parsers and loads the CSV files into a PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite database.  Future
releases will include docker containers with fully loaded databases for all supported databases except
the SQLite.
