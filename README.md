# Baseball Databank Tools - still in alpha under heavy development

The tools provided in this project are intended to make creating databases from the [Baseball Databank files](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank) easier.

Currently only SQLite is supported but support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDb will be added.
